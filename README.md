Hi, thanks for having a look at OmicsCat!

OC is very much a WIP, however I am working to develop this into a simple package for temporal analysis of biological data. Though robust tools for the concatenation of generic -omics data are available, no such tools have been developed with a focus on biological rhythms. I am hoping this will eventually be a useful, quick-and-easy tool for basic multi-omics integration for data collected over time

At present, the function produce a network graph of co-expression relationships between 'molecular species' among different -omics datasets. I have developed this for examination of co-regulatory relationships during circadian rhythms, though any regular-interval timeseries is suitable.

As a final note, I should mention I have used data published by Bignon _et al._ during my development/testing. Thanks! (PMID: 36862511)
